# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a growing area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Text mining and natural language processing have received a lot of focus over the past years, with more and more companies focusing on machine learning and enhancing the way computers understand human-related data.  

This project is based on concepts of text mining (one of the applications of NLP) and data analytics. The [Twitter Streaming API][twitter] is used to download tweets related to specific keywords, which are analyzed by algorithms implemented in ```Javascript```.  

The API response is in a ```JSON``` format, which is parsed and analyzed in ```Javascript```. Twitter data constitutes a rich source that can be used for capturing information about any topic imaginable. However, since the length of characters in a single tweet is limited to 140, analyzing data will be trickier.  
Thatâ€™s where machine learning comes in. By tokenizing the tweets (extracting their bigrams), extracting hashtags, URLs, usernames and emoticons, data analytics is made easier (eg, emoticons like ```:)``` have a positive polarity while emoticons like ```:(``` have a negative polarity. ```:|``` would be a neutral emoticon).  

This data can be used in different use cases such as finding trends related to a specific keyword, measuring brand sentiment, and gathering feedback about new products and services. 
The data insights can be visualized in the web browser in the form of graphs.
